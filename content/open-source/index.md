## My approaach to open source

- Find open source alternates to the software that you use everyday
- Find a mature and a nascent project that you like
- Use them regularly, find what you like about the software and what you don't
- Be on the lookout for bugs, report on github if you find any, better yet fix them!!
- Find interesting features that you like in the software and lookup it's implementation
- Suggest features and improvements that you would like and try to implement them on your own

## Why open source

- It's the foundation of computer software as we know it
- It's an amazing way to expand your network in a meaningful way
- You'll get to work with and learn from or get scolded by the best minds in the industry
- You'll get the experience of working at a big enterprise without the downsides of stress and restrictions
- It'll look great on your resume
- Invaluable experience, that you can take with you
