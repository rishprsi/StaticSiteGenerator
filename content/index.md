Curated resources for your needs

### Why I love programming

- You get to learn what you are working on and how it works
- You can build anything yourself, don't like a software make one yourself
- We have lots of resources to take inspiration from
- Open source is king
- You can build it anywhere as long as you have your laptop.
- Making small cool things that can help my loved ones.
- It lets me take back control over my own devices.
- It's super cheap, unless you are burning that sweet sweet token limit you have
